1. what is variable?
A variable is named container that store the data for uses in program.

Variables are fundamental for working with information in JavaScript, which is a dynamically typed language, meaning the type of data a variable holds can change.

let(block scope): using reassign

const(block scope):- Constants (const) are variables whose values cannot be reassigned after initialization.

var(functional/global):redeclare and reassign

2. what is lexical scope?
Lexical scope is the set of rules that determines variable accessibility based on the physical placement of code.

why 
Data privacy: Lets you create private variables in modules or functions.
React relevance: Explains why event handlers and hooks can access component state even after re-renders.

3. what is hoisting?
Hoisting is JavaScript’s behavior of moving variable and function declarations to the top of their scope (global or function) during the compilation phase.
only for declarations are hoisted, not initializations

why understand hoisting?
Hoisting explains why some variables or functions can be accessed before they’re declared.
It helps avoid bugs like undefined values or ReferenceError.

4. what is closure function?	
A closure is a function that “remembers” the variables from its lexical scope, even after that scope has finished executing.

Inner functions can access variables defined in their outer function, even when the outer function is no longer active.
why use closure
Data privacy: You can hide variables from the global scope.
Functions can “remember” values between calls.

5.what is scope?
Scope determines where variables and functions are accessible in your code.

why Scope Matter
- Prevents variable name conflicts.
- Controls data privacy (important in closures and React hooks).
- Helps write clean, predictable code.
- Essential for understanding hoisting and closures.

4 type of scope

1.Global Scope:Variables declared outside any function/block are accessible everywhere.

2.Function Scope: Variables declared with var inside a function are only accessible within that function.

3.Block Scope: Variables declared with let or const are only accessible inside the {} block.

4.Lexical Scope: Inner functions can access variables from their outer functions (closures).

1.Which array method returns a new array always?
 1. map - The map() methods create a new array by applying a function to each element.
 2. filter() - The filter() method returns a new array containing only the elements that pass a test.
 3. slice() - The slice() method produces a new array with selected elements from the original array.
 4. concat() - The concat() method joins arrays or values together into a new array.
 5. flat() - The flat() method returns a new array with nested arrays flattened.
 6. flatMap() - The flatMap() method maps each element and then flattens the result into a new array.

short explain:

map(): Transforms each element based on a callback function.

Filter(): Returns a new array with elements that pass the test.

Slice(): Extracts a portion of the array without modifying the original.

Combine(): Combines arrays or values into a new array.
